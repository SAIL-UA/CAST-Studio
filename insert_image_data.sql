  'Incredible Data Distribution',
  E'**Description**:\nThe figure titled ''Incredible Data Distribution'' illustrates a scatter plot representing the distribution of data points across two features, labeled as Feature 1 and Feature 2. The extracted text from the figure indicates that the data points are color-coded based on a target variable with values 30, 45, 60, and 75, as shown in the legend.\n\nThe related code script suggests that the figure was generated using Python''s Matplotlib library, where the x-axis represents Feature 1 and the y-axis represents Feature 2. The color of each point corresponds to the target value, providing a visual representation of how the target variable is distributed across the feature space.\n\nThe visualization is a single figure, highlighting the spread and clustering of data points. The scatter plot does not show a clear linear relationship between the features, indicating a diverse distribution of data points. This visualization is useful for identifying patterns or clusters within the data, which may be relevant for further analysis or modeling.',

  E'**Description**:\nThe figure titled ''scatter_plot.png'' illustrates a scatter plot depicting the relationship between ''Periods'' and ''Characters.'' The extracted text from the figure indicates that it visualizes the number of characters plotted against different periods. Based on the related code script, the figure was generated using Python''s Matplotlib library, with ''Periods'' on the x-axis and ''Characters'' on the y-axis. The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between the two variables, suggesting that as the number of periods increases, the number of characters also tends to increase. This visualization highlights a trend where longer periods are associated with more characters, indicating a potential relationship between the duration of periods and the amount of content generated.',

  'Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis - Pairplot',
  E'**Description**:\nThe figure is a pair plot illustrating the relationships between three variables: `feature1`, `feature2`, and `target`. This compound visualization consists of scatter plots and histograms, providing insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.\n\n- **Diagonal Sub-plots**: The diagonal contains histograms for each variable, showing their individual distributions. `feature1` and `target` appear to have a normal distribution, while `feature2` shows a slightly skewed distribution.\n\n- **Off-diagonal Sub-plots**: The scatter plots depict pairwise relationships between the variables. Each scatter plot provides a visual representation of potential correlations:\n  - `feature1` vs. `feature2`: Displays a scattered distribution with no clear linear relationship.\n  - `feature1` vs. `target`: Shows a similar scattered pattern, indicating a weak or no correlation.\n  - `feature2` vs. `target`: Also exhibits a scattered distribution, suggesting minimal correlation.\n\nThe purpose of this figure is to visually assess the distribution and relationships between the variables, aiding in exploratory data analysis. The lack of strong linear patterns in the scatter plots suggests that these features may not have significant linear relationships with each other.',

  'Feature Engineering - New Feature Distribution',
  E'**Description**:\nThe figure titled ''Feature Engineering - New Feature Distribution'' illustrates a histogram depicting the distribution of a newly engineered feature, labeled as ''Feature 3.'' The x-axis represents the range of values for Feature 3, spanning from approximately -500 to 300, while the y-axis indicates the count of occurrences for each bin.\n\nThe histogram is overlaid with a kernel density estimate (KDE) curve, which provides a smoothed representation of the data distribution. The KDE curve suggests that the data is approximately normally distributed, with a peak centered around zero.\n\nThis visualization is a single figure, focusing on the distribution characteristics of Feature 3. The histogram reveals that most data points are concentrated near the center, with fewer occurrences as the values move towards the extremes. This pattern indicates that Feature 3 may have been standardized or normalized during the feature engineering process.\n\nOverall, the figure demonstrates the central tendency and spread of the newly engineered feature, providing insights into its potential impact on subsequent analyses or modeling tasks.',
