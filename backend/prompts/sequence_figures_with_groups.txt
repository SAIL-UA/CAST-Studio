### Instructions:
You are an expert in data storytelling and logical sequencing of data visualizations. You have been provided with figures that are organized into **groups** AND some figures that are **ungrouped**. Your task is to create a logical narrative sequence that:
1. Respects the thematic relationships within groups
2. Integrates ungrouped figures contextually
3. Creates a cohesive story flow across groups and standalone figures

### Input Structure:
You will receive:
- **Groups**: Collections of related figures with group names and descriptions
- **Ungrouped Figures**: Individual figures not assigned to any group
- **Theme and Objective**: The overarching narrative goal

### Task:
1. Analyze the group names, descriptions, and the figures within each group
2. Analyze the ungrouped figures and their relationship to the groups
3. Determine the optimal sequence that could be:
   - Group-first: Start with groups, then integrate ungrouped figures
   - Integrated: Mix groups and ungrouped figures based on narrative flow
   - Context-driven: Place ungrouped figures where they best support the story
4. Insert figure placeholders: `[FIGURE: filename]`

### Sequencing Guidelines:
1. **Group Coherence**: Keep figures within a group together when they tell a connected story
2. **Contextual Integration**: Place ungrouped figures where they provide context, transitions, or additional insights
3. **Narrative Flow**: Ensure smooth transitions between groups and standalone figures
4. **Logical Progression**: Follow patterns like:
   - Time-based: Chronological ordering across groups
   - Overview-to-detail: Start with broad groups, drill down to specifics
   - Problem-solution: Groups showing problem, ungrouped showing context, groups showing solution
   - Thematic: Group similar themes together, use ungrouped as bridges

### Output Format:
1. **Chosen Storytelling Structure**: [Name the structure you're using]
2. **Sequence of Elements**:
   - Group 1: [Group Name]
     - Step 1: [FIGURE: sales_overview_2010.png]
     - Step 2: [FIGURE: marketing_overview.png]
   - Standalone Figure:
     - Step 3: [FIGURE: regional_sales_breakdown.png]
   - Group 2: [Group Name]
     - Step 4: [FIGURE: customer_demographics.png]
     - Step 5: [FIGURE: customer_behavior.png]
   (...continue as needed)
3. **Justification**:
   - Explain why this sequence was chosen
   - Describe how groups and ungrouped figures work together
   - Highlight the narrative arc created by this arrangement

### Example Output:
1. **Chosen Storytelling Structure**: Problem-Solution with Contextual Integration
2. **Sequence of Elements**:
   - Group 1: Data Quality Issues
     - Step 1: missing_values_chart.png
     - Step 2: outlier_detection.png
   - Ungrouped Figure: 
     - Step 3: industry_benchmark.png (provides context for acceptable data quality standards)
   - Group 2: Cleaning Solutions
     - Step 4: imputation_results.png
     - Step 5: cleaned_dataset_summary.png
3. **Justification**:
   - The sequence starts with identifying the problem (Group 1: Data Quality Issues)
   - An ungrouped figure provides external context (industry benchmarks) to frame the severity
   - The sequence concludes with solutions (Group 2: Cleaning Solutions)
   - This creates a clear problem → context → solution narrative arc

### Important Notes:
- Use exact figure filenames as provided in the input
- Groups may have different numbers of figures
- Some sequences may have multiple ungrouped figures interspersed
- The narrative should feel cohesive, not fragmented
- Consider that group names and descriptions are user-provided context that should guide placement
